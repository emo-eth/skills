# Interrogate

Spawn independent OMP reviewers to challenge code changes with one prompt and rubric. OMP does not promise model-family diversity. The signal comes from independent contexts and specialized reviewer contracts. Agreement is strong evidence; a lone finding still needs inspection.

The deliverable is a synthesized verdict. Apply no changes during this skill.

## Step 1, Determine Scope

Identify what to review from context:

- If the user points at specific files or a diff, use that
- If on a feature branch, run `git diff main...HEAD` (or the appropriate base branch) for the full changeset
- If the user's message references recent work, gather the relevant files

Package the diff (or file contents) plus any surrounding context files the reviewers need to understand the code.

## Step 2, State the Intent

Before spawning reviewers, state the intent explicitly. What is this code trying to accomplish? Derive this from:

- The user's message
- Commit messages
- PR description if one exists
- The code itself

Write one clear paragraph. Reviewers challenge whether the work achieves the intent well, not whether the intent itself is correct. When intent is uncertain, state the most evidence-backed interpretation and continue so the user can redirect.

## Step 3, Spawn Reviewers

Read the `interrogate-reviewers` list from `~/.config/pstack/omp-agents.json` when present. Otherwise use `reviewer`, `reviewer`, and `security-reviewer`. Launch every reviewer in one OMP `task` batch. Use no shared writer. Every task is read-only.

Use the configured OMP agent type as the reviewer label. The `default` value means to omit the `agent` field. If a configured type is unavailable, replace it with `reviewer` and report the fallback. Repeated types are valid independent reviews.

Do not claim multi-model coverage unless the current OMP configuration proves that the selected agent types use different model families.

Read `references/reviewer-prompt.md` and fill in the template with:
1. The stated intent
2. The diff or file contents
3. The review rubric from `references/rubric.md`
4. The code-quality lens from `references/code-quality-review.md`

The same filled template goes to all reviewers, so every reviewer applies the same code-quality lens.

Each reviewer produces structured findings as described in the prompt template.

## Step 4, Synthesize

As results come back, build a unified picture:

1. **Parse all findings** from the reviewers
2. **Identify consensus**. Findings raised by 2+ reviewers independently are highest signal.
3. **Identify lone-reviewer findings**. Still worth reading, but weight them accordingly.
4. **Deduplicate**. Reviewers can describe one issue differently. Merge these and note who raised it.
5. **Note disagreements**. Opposing findings are useful context for the verdict.

## Step 5, Lead Judgment

You are the lead reviewer, a pragmatic senior engineer, not a neutral aggregator.

Read `references/lead-judgment.md` for the full framework. Reviewers only see a slice of the codebase. You have the full context (the goal, the constraints, the timeline, which tradeoffs were already considered). Use that context aggressively.

Categorize every finding using these buckets:

- **Act on**. Real issues affecting correctness, security, or maintainability given the actual goals. These would block a real PR.
- **Consider**. Legitimate points, but you're not sure they outweigh the cost of addressing them right now. Worth the user's attention.
- **Noted**. Technically valid but not actionable. Context-dependent, premature optimization, or low-impact given the current stage.
- **Dismissed**. Wrong, nitpicky, or missing context. Brief explanation why.

For each finding, include:
- Which reviewer or agent type raised it
- The category (act on / consider / noted / dismissed)
- A one-line rationale for the categorization

## Output Format

Present the verdict in this structure:

### Intent
> [The stated intent paragraph from Step 2]

### Reviewers
- Reviewer [label]: [OMP agent type], [N findings] (one bullet per reviewer)

### Act On
[Findings that should be addressed. For each: description, which reviewers raised it, why it matters.]

### Consider
[Findings worth thinking about. For each: description, which reviewers raised it, tradeoff involved.]

### Noted
[Valid but low-priority. Brief list.]

### Dismissed
[Rejected findings with brief rationale. This shows the user what was filtered out and why, so they can override your judgment if they disagree.]

### Agreement Map
[Where did reviewers agree, where did they diverge, and what does the pattern tell us?]
